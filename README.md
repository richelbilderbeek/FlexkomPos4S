# FlexkomPos4S

This project is about replacing the OS of the Flexkom POS 4S tablet. I obtained this tablet from some people that feel ripped-off by Flexkom and would like me to put the tablet to good use.

The service `Atci_service` seems suspicious as it has access to all info and has a NFC setup (where Flexkom its card do not use NFC at all (see [this video by Wouter Hol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q02myUvaVHU))

[The tablet is a SANEI N78](http://mlmforum.nl/flessentrekkerij-bij-flexkom).
